## Introduction
## What it does
In this project, we use Python as our primary language to collect, pre-process and analyze Twitter posts with hashtag RBC. Also, we use sentiment analysis to classify positive and negative tweets, then we further perform TF-IDF technique to uncover important keywords inside tweets. Finally, we use MySQL to save data and use PHP to present it with user-friendly UI.
